`xmcp` uses webpack and swc to bundle your tools. You can customize the configuration by adding the following to your `xmcp.config.ts` file:

```typescript
// xmcp.config.ts

const config: XmcpConfig = {
  webpack: (config) => {
    // Add raw loader for images to get them as base64
    config.module?.rules?.push({
      test: /\.(png|jpe?g|gif|svg|webp)$/i,
      type: "asset/inline",
    });

    return config;
  },
};
```
