You can customize the directory where `xmcp` will look for tools and prompts by adding the following to your `xmcp.config.ts` file:

```typescript
const config: XmcpConfig = {
  paths: {
    tools: "path/to/tools",
    prompts: "path/to/prompts",
  },
};

export default config;
```

By default, `xmcp` supports both directories and if `paths` is not set, it will look for tools and prompts in the `/src/tools/` and `/src/prompts/` directories respectively.
If you want to disable one of the directories, you must set it to `false` manually.

This example disables the prompts directory:

```typescript
const config: XmcpConfig = {
  paths: {
    tools: "path/to/tools",
    prompts: false,
  },
};

export default config;
```

The same applies for the `tools` directory.

**Troubleshooting**: If you delete a directory without updating the config, `xmcp` will throw an error and prompt you to update it.
