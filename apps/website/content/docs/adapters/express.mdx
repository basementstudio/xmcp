> **Warning**: This is an experimental feature and may not work as expected.

`xmcp` can work on top of your existing Express project. To get started, run the following command:

```bash
npx init-xmcp@latest
```

After setting up the project, your build and dev command should look like this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "xmcp dev & existing-build-command",
    "build": "xmcp build && existing-build-command"
  }
}
```

When running `dev` or `build` command, `xmcp` will bundle your tools into `.xmcp/adapter`.

You should add the `/mcp` endpoint in your existing server.

```typescript
import { xmcpHandler } from "path/to/.xmcp/adapter";

app.get("/mcp", xmcpHandler);

app.post("/mcp", xmcpHandler);
```

**Note**: `middleware.ts` is not supported in this mode.
