Get started by bootstrapping a [new project](https://app.alpic.ai/new/clone?repositoryUrl=https://github.com/alpic-ai/mcp-server-template-xmcp).

This command will clone the xmcp template repository and setup zero-configuration deployment to Alpic.

## Deploy an existing project

You can deploy your xmcp server to Alpic in 2 steps:

1. Create a new account on [app.alpic.ai](https://app.alpic.ai/).
2. Connect your Github account to Alpic, and select the repository you want to deploy.

You can then access your servers's specific MCP analytics, logs, and evals in the [Alpic dashboard](https://app.alpic.ai/).

Learn more about deploying xmcp to Alpic in the [Alpic documentation](https://docs.alpic.ai/).
