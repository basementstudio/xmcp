First, bootstrap a new project with `npx create-xmcp-app@latest`.

Then, [connect your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) or [use Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli):

```bash
vc deploy
```

## Get started with Vercel CLI

You can initialize a new xmcp app with Vercel CLI with the following command:

```bash
vc init xmcp
```

This will clone the [xmcp example repository](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/xmcp) in a directory called `xmcp`.

Learn more about deploying xmcp to Vercel in the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/backend/xmcp).
