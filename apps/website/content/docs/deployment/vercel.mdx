Vercel supports xmcp with zero-configuration.

First, bootstrap a new project with `npx create-xmcp-app@latest`.

Then, [connect your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) or [use Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli):

```bash
vc deploy
```

Learn more about deploying xmcp to Vercel in the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/backend/xmcp).
