> **Warning**: This is an experimental feature and may not work as expected.

`xmcp` can work on top of your existing Next.js project. To get started, run the following command:

```bash
npx init-xmcp@latest
```

After setting up the project, your build and dev commands should look like this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "xmcp dev & next dev",
    "build": "xmcp build && next build"
  }
}
```

The CLI will ask where to place the `tools` and `prompts` directories and what is the `url` for the MCP server.

It will create the tools and prompts folders and add an endpoint to your Next.js app.

```typescript
// src/app/mcp/route.ts

import { xmcpHandler } from "@xmcp/adapter";

export { xmcpHandler as GET, xmcpHandler as POST };
```

**Note**: `middleware.ts` and `xmcp/headers` are not supported since Next.js already supports those features.
