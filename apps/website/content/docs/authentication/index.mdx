`xmcp` provides several authentication methods to secure your HTTP MCP server:

- [API Key](/docs/authentication/api-key) - Simple API key authentication
- [JWT](/docs/authentication/jwt) - JSON Web Token authentication
- [OAuth](/docs/authentication/oauth) - OAuth provider (experimental)

Choose the authentication method that best fits your security requirements and integrate it with your middleware.
