## Overview

A basic project structure is as follows:

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   ├── middleware.ts   # Middleware for http request/response processing
│   └── tools/          # Tool files are auto-discovered here
│       ├── greet.ts
│       ├── search.ts
│   └── prompts/          # Prompt files are auto-discovered here
│       ├── review-code.ts
│       ├── team-greeting.ts
│   └── resources/      # Resource files are auto-discovered here
│       ├── (config)/app.ts
│       ├── (users)/[userId]/profile.ts
├── dist/               # Built output (generated)
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── xmcp.config.ts       # Configuration file for xmcp
```

## Top-level files

There are the three top-level files that are required for your project:

- `package.json`: Contains your project's dependencies and scripts.
- `tsconfig.json`: Contains your project's TypeScript configuration.
- `xmcp.config.ts`: Contains your project's xmcp configuration.

## Source directory

The `src/` directory houses your project's implementation. xmcp follows a declarative, file-system based approach—simply create a file in the appropriate directory, and it will be automatically discovered and registered.

The optional `middleware.ts` file at the root of `src/` processes HTTP requests and responses. You can customize the location of `tools/`, `prompts/`, and `resources/` directories in your `xmcp.config.ts` file. See the [custom directories](../../configuration/custom-directories) documentation for details.
