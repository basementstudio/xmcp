## Overview

A basic project structure is as follows:

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   ├── middleware.ts   # Middleware for http request/response processing
│   └── tools/          # Tool files are auto-discovered here
│       ├── greet.ts
│       ├── search.ts
│   └── prompts/          # Prompt files are auto-discovered here
│       ├── review-code.ts
│       ├── team-greeting.ts
│   └── resources/      # Resource files are auto-discovered here
│       ├── (config)/app.ts
│       ├── (users)/[userId]/profile.ts
├── dist/               # Built output (generated)
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── xmcp.config.ts       # Configuration file for xmcp
```

## Top-level files

There are the three top-level files that are required for your project:

- `package.json`: Contains your project's dependencies and scripts.
- `tsconfig.json`: Contains your project's TypeScript configuration.
- `xmcp.config.ts`: Contains your project's xmcp configuration.

## Source directory

This is the main directory for your project. It contains your project's source code. At the root, you will find the following directories and files:

- `middleware.ts`: Contains your project's middleware. This is a single, optional file that is used to process the request and response.
- `tools/`: Contains your project's tools.
- `prompts/`: Contains your project's prompts.
- `resources/`: Contains your project's resources.

These directories are customizable, and can be configured in your `xmcp.config.ts` file. For more information, see the [custom directories](../../configuration/custom-directories) documentation.

xmcp follows a declarative, file-system based approach. This means that you can add new tools, prompts, and resources by simply creating a new file in the appropriate directory.

xmcp will automatically discover these files and register them as tools, prompts, and resources.
