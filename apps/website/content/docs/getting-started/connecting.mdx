summary: "Learn how to configure MCP clients to connect to your xmcp server."
---

At this point, you can configure to connect to your MCP server on clients like `Cursor` or `Claude Desktop`.
Notice that, unless you start the development server, or have built your project for production, your server will not be shown available.

## HTTP transport

By default, xmcp will use the port `3001`. If you're using a different port, you can change it in your `xmcp.config.ts` file.

### Cursor

If you're using the HTTP transport with Cursor, your configuration should look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-project": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3001/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

If you're using the HTTP transport with Claude Desktop, your configuration should look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-project": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:3001/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## STDIO transport

If you're using the STDIO transport, your configuration for local development should look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-project": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/my-project/dist/stdio.js"]
    }
  }
}
```
