## System requirements

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- Node.js 20 or later.
- macOS, Windows or Linux.

## Automatic installation

The quickest way to get started with xmcp is using `create-xmcp-app`. This CLI tool allows you to scaffold a template project with all the necessary files and dependencies to get you up and running quickly.

To create an xmcp project, run:

```bash
npx create-xmcp-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

<TerminalPrompt>
  {
    "? What is your project named? (my-xmcp-app)\n? Select a package manager: (Use arrow keys)\n❯ npm \n  yarn \n  pnpm \n  bun\n? Select the transport you want to use: (Use arrow keys)\n❯ HTTP (runs on a server) \n  STDIO (runs on the user's machine)\n? Select components to initialize: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection, and <enter> to proceed)\n❯◉ Tools\n ◉ Prompts\n ◉ Resources"
  }
</TerminalPrompt>

After the prompts, create-xmcp-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

## Manual installation

To manually create an xmcp project, install the required dependencies:

<TerminalTabs
  tabs={[
    {
      label: "pnpm",
      value: "pnpm",
      content: "pnpm i xmcp zod@^3.25.76",
    },
    {
      label: "npm",
      value: "npm",
      content: "npm i xmcp zod@^3.25.76",
    },
    {
      label: "yarn",
      value: "yarn",
      content: "yarn add xmcp zod@^3.25.76",
    },
    {
      label: "bun",
      value: "bun",
      content: "bun add xmcp zod@^3.25.76",
    },

]}
defaultTab="pnpm"
/>

Then, create a new xmcp project:

```bash
npx xmcp init
```
