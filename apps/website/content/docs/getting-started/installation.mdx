## System requirements

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- Node.js 20 or later.
- macOS, Windows or Linux.

## Automatic installation

The quickest way to get started with xmcp is using `create-xmcp-app`. This CLI tool allows you to scaffold a template project with all the necessary files and dependencies to get you up and running quickly.

To create an xmcp project, run:

```bash
npx create-xmcp-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

<TerminalPrompt>
  {
    "? What is your project named? (my-xmcp-app)\n? Select a package manager: (Use arrow keys)\n❯ npm \n  yarn \n  pnpm \n  bun\n? Select the transport you want to use: (Use arrow keys)\n❯ HTTP (runs on a server) \n  STDIO (runs on the user's machine)\n? Select components to initialize: (Press <space> to select, <a> to toggle all, <i> to invert selection, and <enter> to proceed)\n❯◉ Tools\n ◉ Prompts\n ◉ Resources"
  }
</TerminalPrompt>

After the prompts, create-xmcp-app will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

## Manual installation

To manually create an xmcp project, install the required dependencies:

<TerminalTabs
  tabs={[
    {
      label: "pnpm",
      value: "pnpm",
      content: "pnpm i xmcp zod@^3.25.76",
    },
    {
      label: "npm",
      value: "npm",
      content: "npm i xmcp zod@^3.25.76",
    },
    {
      label: "yarn",
      value: "yarn",
      content: "yarn add xmcp zod@^3.25.76",
    },
    {
      label: "bun",
      value: "bun",
      content: "bun add xmcp zod@^3.25.76",
    },
  ]}
  defaultTab="pnpm"
/>

Then add the following scripts to your package.json:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "xmcp dev",
    "build": "xmcp build",
    "start": "node dist/[transport].js"
  }
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `xmcp dev`: Starts the development server. This listens for changes and automatically reloads the server.
- `xmcp build`: Builds the application for production. This will create a `dist` directory with the compiled code.
- `node dist/[transport].js`: Starts the production server. This is the server that will be used in production.

You can then run the scripts based on the package manager you've set up.

Based on the transport you've chosen when bootstrapping your project, the [transport] placeholder will be replaced with the appropriate one.
This is correlated with the `xmcp.config.ts` configuration.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues when running the built server, make sure the transport is matching the configured one in `xmcp.config.ts`.

If you're working with HTTP, your configuration should look like this:

```typescript title="xmcp.config.ts"
const config: XmcpConfig = {
  http: true,
};
```

If you're working with STDIO, your configuration should look like this:

```typescript title="xmcp.config.ts"
const config: XmcpConfig = {
  stdio: true,
};
```

You can have both transports configured, but you'll need to update the scripts to match them. For example, this is a valid script configuration you could use:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "start:http": "node dist/http.js",
    "start:stdio": "node dist/stdio.js"
  }
}
```
