xmcp now supports building and serving UI resources compatible with OpenAI's Apps SDK. Get started by running:

```bash
npx create-xmcp-app@latest
```

<Callout variant="warning">
  OpenAI now supports MCP Apps. This post contains legacy context, so older
  syntax examples may be outdated. New projects should use the MCP App template
  and `_meta.ui` metadata.
</Callout>

Once your project is set up, you'll find two main folders. The prompts folder is excluded from this template by default, but you can easily enable it by modifying the `xmcp.config.ts` file.

### Resources

This folder contains your UI resources. The Apps SDK requires URI template paths to use the `.html` extension. By setting `mimeType: "text/html+skybridge"`, xmcp handles this automatically.

```typescript
export const metadata: ResourceMetadata = {
  name: "your-ui-resource",
  title: "Show your UI resource",
  mimeType: "text/html+skybridge",
};
```

Then, your handler can return the HTML content:

```typescript
export default function handler() {
  return `
    <div>Hello, world!</div>
  `;
}
```

This resource will be accessible at `ui://widget/your-ui-resource.html`, corresponding to the folder structure `(ui)/widget/your-ui-resource`.

For more information on constructing resource URIs, check out the [resources documentation](/docs#resources).

### Tools

This folder contains your tools, which interact with and retrieve your UI resources.

The `ToolMetadata` includes a `_meta.ui` property for MCP Apps metadata, enabling your resources to be displayed within widgets.

Available metadata keys:

- `ui.csp.connectDomains`: Origins allowed for fetch/XHR/WebSocket calls
- `ui.csp.resourceDomains`: Origins for images, scripts, stylesheets, and media
- `ui.domain`: Optional dedicated subdomain for your widget sandbox origin
- `ui.prefersBorder`: Requests a bordered card layout for widgets

```typescript
import { type ToolMetadata } from "xmcp";

export const metadata: ToolMetadata = {
  name: "get-your-ui-resource",
  description: "Show Your UI Resource",
  _meta: {
    ui: {
      csp: {
        connectDomains: ["https://api.example.com"],
        resourceDomains: ["https://cdn.example.com"],
      }
    },
  },
};

export default async function handler() {
  return {
    content: [{ type: "text", text: "Widget ready" }],
  };
}
```

If you don't need CSP or rendering hints, you can omit `_meta.ui` entirely.
