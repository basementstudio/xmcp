Learn how to add paywalls with license keys and track tool usage using [Polar](https://polar.sh/).

## Install Dependencies

Start by installing the Polar plugin:

```bash
npm install @xmcp-dev/polar
```

## Initialize

To initialize the provider and access the validation methods, you need to create a new instance:

```typescript
import { PolarProvider } from "@xmcp-dev/polar";

export const polar = PolarProvider.getInstance({
  type: "sandbox", // or "production", depending on your environment
  token: process.env.POLAR_TOKEN,
  organizationId: process.env.POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID,
  productId: process.env.POLAR_PRODUCT_ID,
});
```

The configuration schema is as follows:

```typescript
interface Configuration {
  type?: "production" | "sandbox";
  token: string;
  organizationId: string;
  productId: string;
}
```

- If `type` is not set, it will default to "production". This affects the token used to authenticate.
- The license key should be provided in the `license-key` header. This is not customizable.

On [polar.sh](https://polar.sh/), create a new product with your desired payment configuration and add the "license key" benefit to the product. You can also add a "meter credit" benefit to the product to track tool usage, and limit the usage of the key.

## Tool Integration

To paywall a tool, you can use the `validateLicenseKey` method to validate the license key and check if the user has access to the tool.
Remember you can use the `xmcp/headers` utility to access the headers of the request and intercept this value.

```typescript
const licenseKey = headers()["license-key"];
const response = await polar.validateLicenseKey(licenseKey);
```

The response object will look like this:

```typescript
{
  valid: boolean;
  code: string;
  message: string;
}
```

You can then access this response object and return the appropriate auto-generated messages as follows:

```typescript
if (!response.valid) {
  return response.message;
}
```

This will prompt the user to the checkout URL in case the license key is invalid.

## Usage Tracking

To track usage we recommend setting a "meter credit" benefit to the product with the following configuration:

Then you can pass an event object to the `validateLicenseKey` method to track usage.

```typescript
const event = {
  name: "tool_call_event",
  metadata: { tool_name: "tool_name", calls: 1 },
};

const response = await polar.validateLicenseKey(licenseKey, event);
```

The event object metadata can have any type of string or number as values.

## Conclusion

You can now add paywalls to your tools and track usage for billing with Polar!
