# Start building with xmcp

Learn the foundations of xmcp and build a complete MCP server, step by step.

At the end, you'll have a fully functional MCP server ready to ship and the knowledge to build your own.

This course will guide you through the basics of xmcp. The following assumes familiarity with MCP and its capabilities. It also assumes you have programming experience, specifically with TypeScript and functional programming.

## Get started

We'll build a complete MCP server step by step, covering both transport layers and all the essential features.
