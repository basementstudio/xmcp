# Start building with xmcp

Learn the foundations of xmcp and build a complete MCP server, step by step.

At the end, you'll have a fully functional MCP server ready to ship and the knowledge to build your own.

This course will guide you through the basics of xmcp. If you wish to learn more in-depth about the Model Context Protocol and xmcp foundations, check out the concepts section.

The following assumes familiarity with MCP and its capabilities. It also assumes you have programming experience, specifically with TypeScript and functional programming.

## MCP concepts & xmcp fundamentals

### Get started

We'll cover two main use cases to tackle the steps of building an MCP server: filesystem manipulation and API calls.

The main difference lies in the transport layer.

The filesystem use case is a good starting point to understand how you can rethink the interaction with your computer.
Through this series, you'll build a server that reads images, compresses them, and saves them to a folder.
You'll be able to modify the aspect ratio to your needs, choose the export format, and set the compression level.
The resulting images will be saved to a directory that will be created automatically. You can also modify the filename as needed.
This demonstrates how you can give an LLM access to your computer and have it perform tasks for you. With this capability comes a huge responsibility to ensure system safety.
Be aware of the risks and always have a backup plan.

The API calls use case shows how you can use MCP to interact with external services.
Through this series, you'll build a server that fetches data from APIs and databases to generate reports.
You'll be able to customize queries to your needs, choose databases for data analysis, generate reports, and save them to platforms like Notion.
This approach enables seamless integration with external services, allowing the LLM to work with real-world data and systems.
