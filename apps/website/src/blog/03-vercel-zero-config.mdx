# Deploy to Vercel with zero-configuration

We're excited to announce that Vercel now natively supports xmcp with zero-configuration. Get started instantly with the [template](https://vercel.com/templates/backend/xmcp-boilerplate), or import your existing projects.

Zero-configuration means you don't need to configure support manually when creating a new project. This step has been removed from the CLI for consistency and simplicity.

This is a step forward on making xmcp more accessible to the community, and more importantly, to make it easier and faster to deploy MCP servers.

When you deploy an xmcp app to Vercel, your server endpoints automatically run as Functions and use Fluid compute by default.

Learn more in the [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/backend/xmcp).
