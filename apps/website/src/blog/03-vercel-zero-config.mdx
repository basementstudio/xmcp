# Deploy to Vercel with zero-configuration

We're excited to announce that Vercel natively supports xmcp with zero-configuration. Get started instantly with the [template](https://vercel.com/templates/backend/xmcp-boilerplate).

This a step forward on making xmcp more accessible to the community, and more importantly, to make it easier and faster to deploy MCP servers.

When you deploy an xmcp app to Vercel, your server endpoints automatically run as Vercel Functions and use Fluid compute by default.

Learn more about xmcp on Vercel in the [documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/backend/xmcp).
